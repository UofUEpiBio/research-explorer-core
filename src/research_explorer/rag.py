"""Retrieval index behind the "Ask Research Explorer" assistant.

This module is deliberately shared between the offline builder (``research_explorer-rag``)
and the online service. Both call the same ``search`` path, so the ranking you tune
with ``research_explorer-rag --query`` is the ranking visitors get — there is no second
implementation to drift out of step.

Two properties of the corpus shape everything here:

* Researcher prose is generic. Every researcher now carries a short bio, but they run
  about 160 characters of institutional summary and draw on a vocabulary of only ~770
  distinct words. They describe domains, not the topics people search for: across all
  471 bios, "ERGM" appears 0 times, "Ebola" once and "Bayesian" once, against 3, 54 and
  49 occurrences in publication titles. So ``_researcher_chunk`` synthesizes a record
  from the topics and titles of that person's publications; the bio is a useful opener,
  never the substance.
* Publication counts are wildly uneven, from zero to a hundred. A roll-up that summed
  every matching paper would hand each query to whoever publishes most, so
  ``roll_up`` counts only a person's best few matches.

#: Score deviation looked like the answer until bare keywords were tried: "dashboard"
#: gives 0.019 and "ERGM" 0.031 — below most off-topic questions — yet both retrieve

#: queries. "who won the world cup in 1998?" tops BM25 at 20.1 because a corpus of 7,738
#: documents contains "cup", "won" and "1998" somewhere.
#:
#: Relevance here is a semantic judgement, so it is left to the model, which sees both
#: the question and the retrieved records and answers ``NO_CONFIDENT_MATCH`` when they do
#: not support one. Retrieval refuses only when it structurally has nothing. Anyone
